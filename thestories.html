									Daniel (Hub Vienna), founded "Open Source Movie". Similar to Wikipedia, the movie is produced with a community of 600+ people; from writing the script to post-production, everything is organized in a collective. He had a challenge with financing his project. Through the Hub, Daniel found out about "The Cosmonaut" movie project (Hub Madrid). They financed their movie through crowd-funding (many people giving little loans starting with $2). The two of them were able to connect and share their innovation approaches.

									Back in March Hub Brussels & member Leander Bindewald launched the <a href="http://www.xchangehub.criterical.net/"><strong>Hub complimentary currency system</strong></a>. The Hub currency, known as a Hubee, allows members to exchange products & services between them. The Hubee is basically a time-currency where 1 Hubee is equivalent to 1 hour of service. You earn Hubees when you provide a service & you can spend it again for 1 hour of services from any other community member. This currency is used to facilitate, track and acknowledge the value created between members.

									Dusan & Juergen are a perfect example of a collaborative project that has come from within the Hub. Over coffee they realised they shared the desire to create something new & positive so why not do this together maximising their skills, networks & possibility for impact.
									
									They created an NGO called <a href="http://www.greencog.eu/"><strong>EEIP</strong></a>; a platform for Business and Policy. EEIP facilitates open & inclusive dialogue within industry involving manufacturers of energy efficient equipment and energy service companies with the European Union policy makers.

									<strong>Moleskine and The Hub Ideas</strong><br/>How can ideas fly from one Hub to the other? The Hub Milan worked with Moleskine to create a fantastic Hub Moleskine notebook and let the Hubber’s projects and ideas travel the world. More than 100 Hub Moleskine notebooks will live in different Hubs around the world and will serve as a canvas where Hubbers can comunicate, represent, sketch their projects. The Moleskine notebooks will then be passed from one Hub to the other spreading the best social innovation ideas.

									The <strong>Green Mobility</strong> Institute is an NGO that develops programs for greater reflection about sustainable urban mobility. In 2 years we have launched 7 initiatives with great national and international media coverage, such as Campus Aberto, Pedal Social e Bicicloteca – a bike-library hybrid, where 300 books are daily distributed to homeless people in order to reconnect them with the community. We are in the Hub for 2 years and since then we have exchanged ideas and collaborated with other members.

									We are <strong>Carbono Zero</strong>. And we can certainly and with ease say that we wouldn’t be what it is in its 10 few months of life if not for the Hub, who esteemed our project, enabled our growth and connected us to a network that enhanced our business. The space is friendly, welcoming and breathes entrepreneurship, and its values meet ours. Besides, the location – in the heart of São Paulo – is a benefit for our project.

									Cezar came to the Hub as an expert to create websites for social projects. In the Hub he not only connected with other innovators, but he also re-connected to his passion for plants and gardening. He met Talia and Sebastian, two designers, focusing on the Human Element of Design. Together, they created a project that works with marginalized people and employes them to build window-farms. Ultimately, this will lead to a re-socializing project which will also make Viennese homes greener.
